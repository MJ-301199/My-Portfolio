    <h3>Extra Curriculars</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sports & Fitness</li>
        - I was a part of the college cricket team. <br>
        - I believe that fitness plays a significant role for a healthy & disciplined life.
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_S4TqzZTXsnRqpq_KD28Q">Youtube</a></li>
        <em>-“Knowledge is power, reading
              is Superpower & Sharing
              knowledge is empowerment.”</em><br>
         - I strongly believe in this quote.
           Hence I started my Youtube
           Channel, where I gain & share
           Tech knowledge.
